        "#1)What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Ans)Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). The main idea is to bundle data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, or object."

        "Ans)A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have. For example, a Car class could define attributes like color and model, and methods like start_engine() and drive()."

        "Ans)An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created. An object has its own state (values for its attributes) and behavior (its methods). For example, my_blue_tesla could be an object of the Car class with color set to \"blue\"."

        "Ans)Abstraction focuses on hiding complexity. It shows only the essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. For example, when you drive a car, you only need to know how to use the steering wheel and pedals (the interface), not how the engine works internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods. It binds the data (attributes) and the code that manipulates the data (methods) together and keeps them safe from outside interference. It's like a capsule that contains both the medicine and the instructions for how it works."

        "Ans)Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special methods in Python that are surrounded by double underscores, like __init__ or __str__. They are also called magic methods. They allow you to emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, defining the __add__ method allows you to use the + operator on objects of your class."

        "Ans)Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (the subclass or child class) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (the superclass or parent class). This promotes code reusability. For example, a Motorcycle class and a Truck class can both inherit common properties like speed and methods like accelerate() from a parent Vehicle class."

        "Ans)Polymorphism (from Greek, meaning \"many forms\") is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In programming, it means that a single function or method name can work for different types of objects. For example, a speak() method could be implemented differently in a Dog class (\"Woof!\") and a Cat class (\"Meow!\"), but you can call animal.speak() on any animal object.\n",

It lets you write generic code that can work with objects of different classes without needing to know their specific type, as long as they share a common interface (e.g., have the same method names). This simplifies the code and makes it easier to add new classes to the system later."

Python provides the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module to implement this."

You can then have a list of objects from these different subclasses and call the same method on each one, and the correct version of the method will be executed for each object.
